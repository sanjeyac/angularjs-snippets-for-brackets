# AngularJS code templates for Brackets

This is a set of snippets for [Brackets by Adobe](http://brackets.io/)

It contains the following skeletons, based on [John Papa's AngularJS Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide)

* controller
* directive
* factory
* filter
* module
* service

## Install

1. In order to install the snippets you have to install 'Brackets Snippets (by edc)' from the Extension manager ( File > Extension manager ) and download the [angularjsSnippets.yml from the repository](https://github.com/sanjeyac/angularjs-snippets-for-brackets)
2. After you have installed the Snippet Manager click on the Snippet Manager icon on the right side (a bulb)
3. A panel will appear on the bottom. Click on Settings and then on Import.
4. Select angularjsSnippets.yml from where you downloaded and it's done.

## Usage

Write 'ngcontroller' on a Javascript file to generate an AngularJS Controller skeleton,
press TAB to customize all the paramaters of the code.

The following elements works in the same way:
* ngcontroller - a controller
* ngdirective - a directive
* ngfactory - a factory
* ngfilter - a filter
